**Week 1-2: Leadership Foundation**
1. Start with [Team Mentoring](./leadership/team-mentoring.md)
2. Study [Conflict Resolution](./leadership/conflict-resolution.md)
3. Review [Tech Lead Behavioral Questions](./interview-questions/tech-lead-behavioral.md)
4. Prepare your leadership stories using STAR method

**Week 3-4: Technical Leadership**
1. Master [Architecture Decisions & ADRs](./technical-leadership/architecture-decisions.md)
2. Understand [System Design Trade-offs](./system-design/trade-offs-guide.md)
3. Study [Agile Leadership](./process/agile-leadership.md)
4. Practice system design with trade-off discussions

**Week 5+: Polish & Practice**
1. Review technical fundamentals (C#, .NET, SQL)
2. Practice mock interviews
3. Refine your leadership story bank
4. Review your real project examples

### Study Priority Matrix

| Priority | Topics | Time Investment |
|----------|--------|-----------------|
| **🔥 CRITICAL** | Leadership, Architecture Decisions, Trade-offs, Behavioral Questions | 60% |
| **⚡ HIGH** | Agile Leadership, System Design, C# Fundamentals | 30% |
| **📘 MEDIUM** | Design Patterns, SQL, Strategic Topics | 10% |

## 🎯 Tech Lead vs. Senior Engineer

Understanding the difference is key:

| Aspect | Senior Engineer | Tech Lead |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| **Primary Focus** | Technical excellence | Team success through technical leadership |
| **Success Metric** | Quality of your code | Team's velocity and growth |
| **Decisions** | How to implement | What to build and why |
| **Communication** | With team | With team, stakeholders, and leadership |
| **Growth** | Your skills | Team's skills and capabilities |
| **Time Allocation** | 90% coding, 10% other | 50% coding, 30% leadership, 20% strategy |

**Interview Focus Shift**:
- Senior Engineer: "Can you solve hard problems?"
- Tech Lead: "Can you lead a team to solve hard problems?"

   - 1-2 failure/learning stories

2. **Review Your Projects**:
   - Quantify your impact (improved by X%, reduced by Y)
   - Understand team dynamics and growth
   - Know the trade-offs you made and why

3. **Refresh Technical Fundamentals**:
   - You'll still get technical questions
   - Be ready to discuss trade-offs, not just solutions

- Balance technical and people stories

#### For Technical Questions:
- Discuss trade-offs explicitly
- Ask clarifying questions about scale, constraints
- Think out loud about your decision process
- Show how you'd involve the team
- Consider operational implications

#### For System Design:
- Start with requirements and constraints
- Discuss multiple approaches and trade-offs
- Justify decisions with data/reasoning
- Show how you'd validate the design
- Mention how you'd document it (ADRs)

### Questions to Ask Them

**About the Team**:
- "What does success look like for this role in the first 6 months?"
- "Tell me about the team I'd be leading - size, experience levels?"
- "What are the biggest challenges the team is currently facing?"

**About Leadership**:
- "How does the company support tech leads in developing leadership skills?"
