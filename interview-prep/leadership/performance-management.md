# Performance Management

## 📝 Overview

As a Tech Lead, managing team performance is crucial. This includes setting expectations, giving feedback, conducting reviews, and helping team members grow or addressing underperformance.

**Key Principle**: Performance management is ongoing, not an annual event. It's about continuous feedback and growth.

## 💬 Ongoing Feedback & Coaching

### The Feedback Equation

**Feedback = Observation + Impact + Question/Suggestion**

```markdown
❌ BAD:
"Your code quality is poor."

✅ GOOD:
**Observation**: In your last 3 PRs, I noticed missing error handling and few unit tests.
**Impact**: This led to 2 production bugs and increased review time for the team.
**Question**: What's making it challenging to include these? How can I help?
```

---

### Types of Feedback

#### 1. Positive Reinforcement (Catch them doing good!)

```markdown
**When**: See behavior you want to encourage

**Template**:
"I really appreciated [specific action] because [impact].
Keep doing that!"

**Example**:
"I really appreciated how you proactively helped Sarah debug that tricky
caching issue yesterday. It unblocked her and showed great team collaboration.
Keep doing that - that's exactly the kind of teamwork we need."

**Frequency**: As often as possible! Don't save all feedback for problems.
```

---

#### 2. Constructive Feedback (Course Correction)

```markdown
**When**: Behavior needs to change

**Template**:
"I noticed [observation]. This is impacting [impact].
Can we discuss how to [improvement]?"

**Example**:
"I noticed you've been late to our daily standup 3 times this week.
This impacts the team because we're waiting to start and losing momentum.
Can we discuss what's causing the lateness and how to address it?"

**Timing**: As soon as appropriate (don't wait for review)
```

---

#### 3. Developmental Feedback (Growth Opportunity)

```markdown
**When**: Opportunity to stretch and grow

**Template**:
"You're strong at [strength]. I think you're ready to take on [challenge].
This will help you develop [skill]."

**Example**:
"You're strong at implementing features. I think you're ready to take on
leading the design for the new payment system. This will help you develop
your architecture skills, which is key for senior level.

I'll be here to support you through it."

**Purpose**: Stretch assignments for growth

## 🎤 Common Interview Questions

### Q1: "How do you handle underperformance on your team?"

**STAR Answer**:

**Situation**:
"I had a mid-level engineer, Mike, whose velocity dropped significantly over 3 months. He was delivering 2-3 story points per sprint when his baseline was 5-6."

**Task**:
"Identify the root cause and get Mike back on track without negatively impacting the team."

**Action**:
"I took a systematic approach:

**1. Private 1:1 Conversation** (Empathetic)
'Mike, I've noticed your velocity has been lower lately. Is everything okay?
I want to understand what's happening and how I can help.'

**2. Listen & Diagnose**
Turned out:
- Personal issues (family illness)
- Overwhelmed by complex legacy code
- Afraid to ask for help

**3. Create Support Plan**
- Flexible hours for family situation
- Pair him with senior engineer on complex work
- Explicitly gave permission to ask for help
- Reassigned one particularly complex story

**4. Set Clear Expectations**
'Let's aim for 4 points next sprint with this support.
Check in with me daily if you're blocked.
We'll reassess in 2 weeks.'

**5. Document & Track**
- Weekly 1:1s to track progress
- Adjusted workload as needed
- Celebrated small wins"

**Result**:
"Within 6 weeks:
- Velocity returned to 5-6 points
- Quality remained high
- Mike reported feeling supported, not pressured
- Team appreciated transparent communication

He later told me that conversation prevented burnout."

**Learning**:
"Key lessons:
1. **Assume positive intent** - Usually there's a reason
2. **Listen first** - Don't jump to solutions
3. **Provide support** - Remove obstacles
4. **Be human** - Life happens
5. **Document** - Track progress objectively

**When it doesn't work**:
If after support there's no improvement, I escalate:
- More formal PIP process
- Involve HR
- But always with clarity and support"

---

### Q2: "Describe a time you gave difficult feedback."

**STAR Answer**:

**Situation**:
"I had a senior engineer, Lisa, who was technically brilliant but frequently dismissive in code reviews. Comments like 'This is wrong' or 'Obviously this won't work' without explanation."

**Task**:
"Address the behavior without damaging her confidence or our relationship."

**Action**:
"I used the SBI (Situation-Behavior-Impact) model:

**Preparation**:
- Collected specific examples (3 recent PRs)
- Scheduled private 1:1
- Planned my opening carefully

**The Conversation**:

**Situation**: 'Lisa, I want to discuss code review feedback.'

**Behavior**: 'In the last week, I've noticed comments like [showed examples].
They're technically correct, but come across as harsh.'

**Impact**: 'Two junior engineers mentioned feeling discouraged. One said they're
afraid to submit PRs. This is impacting psychological safety on the team.'

**Pause & Listen**:
She was surprised - hadn't realized the impact.
Explained she was just trying to be efficient.

**Collaborate on Solution**:
'I know you don't mean to discourage people. What if we tried:
- Start with what's good in the PR
- Explain WHY something needs to change
- Ask questions instead of commands

For example:
Instead of: 'This is wrong'
Try: 'This works, but if we use X pattern instead, it'll be more maintainable because Y.'

**Follow-up Plan**:
- I'll review her next few code reviews
- Give her real-time feedback
- Check in with junior engineers
- Reassess in 2 weeks"

**Result**:
"Within 2 weeks:
- Lisa's feedback style dramatically improved
- Junior engineers reported feeling supported
- Actually led to better code reviews - explanations helped everyone learn
- Lisa thanked me later: 'I didn't realize I was doing that. Thanks for telling me.'

Team collaboration improved measurably."

**Learning**:
"Difficult feedback is a gift if delivered well:
1. **Be specific** - Show examples
2. **Be timely** - Don't wait
3. **Be private** - Respect dignity
4. **Focus on behavior** - Not personality
5. **Collaborate** - Solve together
6. **Follow up** - Don't just fire and forget

The conversation was uncomfortable for 10 minutes.
Avoiding it would have hurt the team for months."
